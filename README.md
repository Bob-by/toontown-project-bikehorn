# Project: Bikehorn

Project Bikehorn is a content pack for Toontown Rewritten that aims to enhance the experience as faithfully as possible by using the original resolution textures released as part of the "Spotify" repository.

The result is a near 1:1 idea of what a faithful modern day Toontown could've looked like, staying as true as possible to the original game.

***NOTE: DUE TO THE EXTREMELY LARGE TEXTURE SIZES OF THIS PACK, THERE IS A HIGH CHANCE OF LAG ON MID-TO-LOW-RANGE PCS. INTEL HD GRAPHICS CARDS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED TO BE USED WHEN RUNNING THIS PACK. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.***

# FAQ

**Q:** How do I install this?

**A:** Grab a copy of the ZIP in the Releases section. Go to your Toontown Rewritten installation directory and make a new folder called "resources", and put the .mf file from the ZIP in the new folder you've created. Start the game, go into the Video section of the options, scroll all the way down, and tick both "Enable Experimental Settings" and "Remove Maximum Texture Size". Scroll up a tiny bit, enable "Project: Bikehorn", and finally hit "Apply".

**Q:** I found an issue/want to contribute!

**A:** Go ahead! This project is open sourced for that exact reason. Open an issue/pull request and I'll review it.

**Q:** Can I use _____?

**A:** Go right ahead, no need for permission at all but credit would be nice.

**Q:** Some things look/sound a bit different from the original game. Why is that?

**A:** To enhance the experience slightly, I've made some personal edits to parts of the pack to fix some minor oversights and overall bring it closer to what I believe Disney intended.

The things changed are:

* Flipped Bossbot/Sellbot arms/legs to be consistent with the other Cog types
* The unused Tug-o-War theme has been reimplemented
* Fixed Lawbot HQ scale not displaying the emblem (credits to yippie2020!)
* Fixes to a large variety of RGB issues caused by faulty TIF files in the original model repository, such as Estates and Catching Game

It's also possible that I made a mistake. In which case, please open an issue/pull request if possible!

**Q:** Will this continue to be updated?

**A:** Of course! There's still some minor issues to work out, so please open an issue if you see something (or contact me on Discord: toonjoey#4133).

**Q:** Will sound effects be worked on?

**A:** Sadly, sound effects are on an indefinite hiatus for the moment.

**Q:** Why do some textures look pixellated?

**A:** The Spotify repo only has content dating up to around 2008. This means things like the finalized Toon Hall, a couple minor textures for parties, and Field Offices weren't included. The original textures were used where applicable, and in most cases they were simply scaled up from their original resolutions, resulting in the pixellated look mentioned earlier.
